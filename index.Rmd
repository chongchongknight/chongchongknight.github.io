# About me
My Name is Yiming Li. I receive my master degree at at [Columbia University in the City of New York](https://www.columbia.edu/), mailman school of public health from the department of biostatistics. I finished my undergraduate study in [Fudan university](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/), Shanghai, China with bachelors degree of mathematics. 

# Research Interest and Projects
My interest is **high dimension analysis** and **large-scale analysis**. Currently, I am working on the following projects:

*[A Spatially Adaptive Edge-Preserving Denoising Method](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9187417)

I hope to submit the following papers on arXiv after finalizing , but you can click to see the current version:

*[A Double Projection Approach for Safe and Efficient Semi-Supervised Data-Fusion](SS_data_fusion.pdf)

*[Genetics- Learning Conditional Density with high-dimensional covariates](distrbution_learning.pdf) and its [slide](distribution_learning_ppt.pdf)

*[A Adaptive Linear Programming For Quantile Regression With Shared Design](LP__Copy.pdf)

*[A neural network approach for large-scale imputation for data with informative missingness by minimizing re-calibrated Wasserstein distance](DL_QR_for_all.pdf)
